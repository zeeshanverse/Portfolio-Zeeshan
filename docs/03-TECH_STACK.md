# 03 — Tech Stack & Rationale

This doc records _what_ technologies the project uses and _why_, plus what was considered and rejected. When you revisit a decision in 6 months, you should be able to read this doc and remember the reasoning without re-litigating it.

For significant or controversial decisions, also write an ADR (see `adr/`). This doc is the high-level summary.

## Frontend

### Why Next.js (App Router)?

- **SSR/SSG out of the box** — public pages need server-rendered HTML for SEO; the App Router makes per-route choice trivial (`force-static`, `revalidate`, `dynamic`).
- **Image optimization** — built-in `next/image` handles AVIF/WebP and lazy loading; meaningful for Lighthouse.
- **One mental model for routing**, layouts, loading/error UIs, server components.
- **Self-hosted** via a standard Node server (`next start`) — full control, no platform lock-in.

**Rejected alternatives**

- _Astro:_ great for content sites; less ideal for an admin dashboard with interactive forms. Mixing islands gets awkward.
- _Remix:_ solid, but ecosystem and hosting story are smaller than Next.
- _SvelteKit:_ I want React experience visible on the resume.
- _CRA / Vite SPA:_ no SSR, worse SEO, no built-in metadata API.

### Why TypeScript strict?

Non-negotiable. The class of bugs strict typing catches (especially around API responses) is significant. `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`.

### Why Tailwind + shadcn/ui?

- **Tailwind:** design tokens become utility classes; no naming bikeshed; tiny prod CSS.
- **shadcn/ui:** components are _copied into the repo_, not installed. You own them, customize them, no version churn. Built on Radix primitives (a11y solved).

**Rejected alternatives**

- _MUI / Chakra:_ heavier, opinionated theming systems that fight Tailwind.
- _Hand-rolled CSS modules:_ fine, but slower iteration.

## Backend

### Why Express (vs. Next API routes only)?

The PRD explicitly calls for a separate Node/Express backend. Reasons that hold up:

- **Separation of concerns:** the API can be deployed, scaled, and rate-limited independently of the marketing site.
- **Resume signal:** "fullstack" reads stronger when the API is genuinely a separate service.
- **Reusability:** if I later build a mobile app or a CLI, the API serves them too.
- **Background jobs / longer-running work:** easier to add to a real Node server than to a serverless Next API route.

Trade-offs accepted: extra deploy target, extra CORS config, more infra to monitor.

### Why Prisma?

- Generated, typed client — every query is type-checked against the schema.
- First-class migrations (`prisma migrate`).
- Excellent introspection / Studio UI for debugging during dev.

**Rejected:** Drizzle (great but younger, less docs); Knex/raw SQL (more boilerplate, no type generation).

### Why Zod?

Shared between `apps/web` and `apps/api` via `packages/shared`. Define a schema once, get:

- Runtime validation on the API side.
- Form validation on the client (`react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers/zod`).
- Inferred TypeScript types (`z.infer<>`).

This eliminates a whole category of "frontend and backend disagree about the shape" bugs.

### Why JWT + cookie (vs. session in DB, vs. Auth0/Clerk)?

- **Single admin user.** The login surface is tiny.
- **Cookie, not localStorage**, because cookies sent automatically and protected from XSS via `HttpOnly`.
- **Don't reach for Auth0/Clerk** for a one-user system — too much config and a third-party dependency for negligible benefit.

If multi-user is ever added: re-evaluate (Lucia, Auth.js).

## Data layer

### PostgreSQL

The default. Relational, great with Prisma, free hosting tiers, full-text search built in (sufficient for blog search at this scale).

### Cloudflare R2 for media

S3 API, no egress fees. Cheaper than S3, simpler than self-hosting MinIO.

## DevEx & quality

| Concern         | Tool                              | Why                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Monorepo        | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo       | Fast, low-config; local task caching out of the box. |
| Lint            | ESLint flat config                | Standard.                                            |
| Format          | Prettier                          | Standard.                                            |
| Pre-commit      | lint-staged + husky               | Catches issues before CI.                            |
| Commits         | Conventional Commits + commitlint | Drives changelog generation.                         |
| Tests           | Vitest, Supertest, Playwright     | Fast, native ESM, modern.                            |
| Typecheck in CI | `tsc --noEmit`                    | Don't ship type errors.                              |

## Hosting

- **VPS** for web + API + DB: everything on one server (`next start` + Express + Postgres), managed with Docker Compose + Nginx reverse proxy.
- **Cloudflare** for DNS, CDN, and R2 media storage.

Total monthly cost target: **≤ $10** (VPS ~$5–6/mo, Cloudflare free tier).

## Things I am explicitly _not_ using (yet)

- **GraphQL** — overkill for a single-client REST API.
- **tRPC** — would be nice, but the user's brief specifies a separate Express API; tRPC really wants both ends of the wire to be its client/server.
- **Redux / Zustand** — UI state is small enough for React state and URL params.
- **Server actions (Next)** — see Express decision above; consistency across pages.
- **Docker for dev** — local Postgres via `docker compose up db` is sufficient; no need to fully Dockerize the dev workflow.

If any of these are added later, write an ADR explaining the trigger.
