# 02 — User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

Each story follows the form **As a [persona], I want [capability], so that [benefit]**, with explicit acceptance criteria written in Given/When/Then. Acceptance criteria are what the test suite will verify.

## Traceability

When you implement a story, reference its ID in the commit and PR title:

```
feat(US-2.2): filter projects by tag
```

This makes the path from PRD → user story → commit → deploy traceable end to end.
