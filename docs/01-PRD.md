# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Status:** Draft v0.1
**Owner:** zeeshanverse
**Last updated:** 2026-04-28

> A PRD answers: _what_ are we building, _who_ is it for, _why_, and _how do we know it's done_. Not how it's built that's the job of the architecture and tech-stack docs.

---

## 1. Summary

A personal fullstack portfolio site that showcases my projects, technical writing, and contact channels, with LLM Chat which will be probably hosted locally and a private admin dashboard for managing content without redeploying. The public site optimizes for fast first impressions on recruiters and engineers; the admin side optimizes for me.

**One-liner:** "A portfolio I'm proud to send to a hiring manager, that I can update from a phone."

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- G1. Convert visitors with hiring intent into a contact-form submission or email click.
- G2. Demonstrate fullstack capability through both content (projects shown) and craft (the site itself is the demo with open-source code).
- G3. Let me publish a project or blog post in under 5 minutes without touching code or redeploying.
- G4. Score ≥ 95 on Lighthouse Performance, A11y, Best Practices, SEO for the landing page.

### Non-goals (explicitly out of scope for v1)

- Real-time features (websockets, live chat).
- Analytics dashboards beyond what Vercel/Plausible provide for free.
- i18n / multi-language. English only at launch.
- AT Protocol - Connecting this portfolio to the bluesky decentralized social network.

## 3. Target users & personas

| Persona                        | Primary intent                                        | Success looks like                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recruiter / hiring manager** | Skim profile in 60 seconds, decide if worth a call.   | Reads hero + 3 projects, clicks "Contact" or copies email. |
| **Engineer peer**              | Evaluate code quality, read a blog post, browse repo. | Clicks GitHub link, reads a blog post end-to-end.          |
| **Future me (admin)**          | Add/edit projects and posts on the go.                | Logs in on phone, publishes, signs out.                    |

---

## 4. User stories (high level)

Detailed list with acceptance criteria lives in [`02-USER_STORIES.md`](./02-USER_STORIES.md). Top-level epics:

- **E1. Public landing & about**: visitor lands, immediately understands who I am and what I do.
- **E2. LLM Ask about me**: visitor lands, notices LLM Chat in which he can ask something about me or use prepoulated question.
- **E3. Project showcase**: visitor browses projects, filters by stack, opens a detail (project) page.
- **E4. Blog**: visitor reads posts; posts have rich content (code blocks, images).
- **E5. Contact**: visitor submits a message; I get notified by email; submissions are stored.
- **E6. Recommendations**: visitor browses recommendations, which are real people connected via linkedin or github.
- **E7. Developer recommends**: friendly developer comes to recommendation tab, leaves a good referral about me.
- **E8. Admin auth**: I log in via email link on a private route.
- **E9. Admin CRUD**: I create/edit/delete/publish projects and posts; upload images.
- **E10. Site polish**: dark/light mode, smooth transitions, responsive, accessible.

## 6. Non-functional requirements

| Category         | Requirement                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance      | LCP < 2.0s on landing; TTI < 3.0s on 4G. JS bundle < 150KB gzipped on landing.                                                                                |
| LLM Performance  | first-token latency (TTFT) and streaming throughput, separate from page load. A target like "TTFT < 1.5s, ≥ 20 tokens/s" sets a usable bar.                   |
| LLM availability | If the LLM is unreachable or warming, the chat UI shows a "Chat offline — use the contact form" fallback within 3s.                                           |
| Safety           | prompt-injection hardening, output filtering for hallucinated personal details, rate limit per IP/session.                                                    |
| Compute budget   | self-hosted, document the resource ceiling (e.g., "LLM uses ≤ X GB RAM, falls back to queue if concurrent requests > N").                                     |
| Accessibility    | WCAG 2.1 AA. Keyboard navigable. Visible focus states. Reduced-motion respected.                                                                              |
| SEO              | Server-rendered (or SSG) HTML for all public pages. Structured data (JSON-LD) for `Person` and `BlogPosting`.                                                 |
| Security         | HTTPS only. CSRF protection on form submits. Helmet headers on API. Rate limiting on `/contact` and `/admin/login`. Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost ≥ 12). |
| Privacy          | No third-party trackers. Privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible or none). Contact submissions retained 12 months.                                              |
| Reliability      | Uptime ≥ 99.5%. API responds < 300ms p95.                                                                                                                     |
| Browsers         | Last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. iOS Safari 16+. Android Chrome 100+.                                                                        |

## 7. Success metrics

- M1. **Landing Lighthouse**: ≥ 99 across all four categories.

- M3. **Contact conversion**: ≥ 5% of `/contact` page visits submit the form.
- M4. **Bounce rate** (Plausible): < 60% on landing.
- M5. **Personal**: I send the link to ≥ 10 recruiters within 1 month of launch.

---

## 8. Constraints & assumptions

- **Solo build.** Time-boxed to ~6 weeks of evenings/weekends.
- **Budget:** ≤ $0 Will try to self host everything.
- **Domain:** will be `zeeshan.dev`, but in future will maybe buy `aleksajanjic.com`
- **Content:** at launch, ≥ 5 projects and ≥ 2 blog posts.

## 9. Risks

| Risk                                          | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope creep (real-time chat, comments, etc.)  | High       | High   | Strict v1 scope; "later" list documented below.                 |
| Spending weeks on design polish               | High       | Medium | Time-box design phase to 1 week; ship at "good," iterate after. |
| Admin UX nobody but me sees → over-investment | Medium     | Low    | Use a component library (e.g., shadcn) for admin to ship fast.  |

---

## 10. "Later" list (post-v1 ideas)

Captured here to keep them out of v1 scope without losing the idea:

- Comments on blog posts (via GitHub Discussions integration or Linkedin?).
- Newsletter signup + transactional sends.
- Project case-study long-form template.
- "Now" page (à la nownownow.com).
- Add portfolio to the https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios
- Webmentions.
- View-counter / read-time signals.
- Related-posts recommendations.
- Public RSS-to-email subscribe.
- Do I run the LLM on the same VPS as the API, or a separate inference box? (Affects resource ceilings above.)
- What model? (llama-3.x, qwen, phi — pick before tech-stack doc gets updated.)
- Is "verified by GitHub" enough, or do I want a small "I personally know this person" badge separate from "OAuth-verified"?

## 11. Open questions

- [ ] Markdown for blog content.

## 12. Sign-off

This PRD is "good enough" when you can answer **yes** to all of:

- [ ] I can describe the product in two sentences without looking at this doc.
- [ ] Every feature in §5 traces to a goal in §2.
- [ ] I am comfortable defending each item in §6 to a peer engineer.
- [ ] The "later" list contains every idea I had to suppress.
